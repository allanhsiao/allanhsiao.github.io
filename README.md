# Allan Hsiao

I work on questions in environmental and development economics using tools from empirical industrial organization. I will join the Department of Economics at Princeton University as an assistant professor in the 2022-2023 academic year.

## Working papers

### Coordination and Commitment in International Climate Action: Evidence from Palm Oil
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
  Weak environmental regulation has global consequences. When domestic regulation fails, the international community can intervene by targeting emitters with import tariffs. I develop a dynamic empirical framework for evaluating import tariffs as a substitute for domestic regulation, and I apply it to the market for palm oil, a major driver of deforestation and one of the largest sources of emissions globally. Coordinated, committed tariffs reduce emissions by 39% relative to 40% under domestic regulation, but free-riding concerns undermine coordination and static incentives undermine commitment.

### Democratization and Infrastructure Investment: Evidence from Healthcare in Indonesia
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
  Does electoral accountability discipline public spending? After the fall of Suharto, Indonesia held local elections for the first time in decades. I use a dynamic discrete choice framework to study how democratization affected the spatial allocation of public investment in healthcare infrastructure. On one hand, democratization limits distortions from Suharto-era biases toward certain areas, such as those within the patronage network. On the other hand, spillover effects are less internalized as districts become more focused on their own constituents.

### Educational Investment in Spatial Equilibrium: Evidence from Indonesia
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper quantifies the long-run aggregate and distributional effects of Indonesia’s Sekolah Dasar INPRES program, one of the largest school construction programs in history. I do so with a spatial equilibrium model in which graduates migrate and seek employment nationally. I find that the program increased aggregate output by 8% and regional inequality by 12%, as migration fuels output gains but drains rural regions. Mobility magnifies these effects and generates an equity-efficiency tradeoff.

### Rising Sea Levels, Adaptation, and Urban Development in Jakarta
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
  More than one-third of Jakarta will be below sea level by 2050, exposing much of the city to coastal flooding. In response, the Indonesian government has begun construction on a $40 billion sea wall. How effective is a sea wall compared to other policies, such as relocation subsidies or zoning reforms? To answer this question, I study the effects of flooding in Jakarta historically. I monetize the cost of flood risk by measuring its capitalization into land values, and I embed these costs in a spatial model of urban development to study how developers, firms, and individuals make location decisions in response to rising flood risk. In the short run, the sea wall reduces flood exposure more than other policies do, although it does so at high cost. In the long run, it increases the concentration of activity in flood-prone areas. Indeed, the proposed sea wall has already boosted investment in the city's coastal north – precisely the area most vulnerable to flooding as sea levels continue to rise.
