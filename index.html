  <div class="popup" id="work5" style="display:none">Sea level rise poses an existential threat to Jakarta, which faces frequent and worsening flooding. The government has responded with a proposed sea wall. In this setting, I study how government intervention complicates long-run adaptation by creating coastal moral hazard. I quantify this force with a dynamic spatial model of urban development and flooding. I show that moral hazard generates coastal lock-in by delaying inland migration, and I evaluate policies for reducing this friction.</div>

  ]</div>
  <div class="popup" id="work4" style="display:none">This paper studies how global warming affects deforestation and agricultural land use. Using global, high-resolution data on temperature, deforestation, and land cover from 2001 to 2019, we find that extreme heat causes large and persistent forest loss on the world’s agricultural frontier. This effect is strongest in the tropics, in areas with the most temperature-sensitive crops, and in regions with the most inelastic demand for agricultural products, and we find no evidence that it is offset by global spillovers. Deforestation in response to extreme heat can be explained almost entirely by cropland expansion. We corroborate these findings using agricultural census data from Brazil, where extreme heat leads to productivity declines, cropland expansion, and limited additional input adjustment or land reallocation. Our estimates imply that extreme heat has already driven substantial forest loss and that projected warming through 2100 could lead to an additional 28 million hectares of deforestation. These findings challenge the view that economic reallocation will necessarily soften the economic and environmental consequences of climate change, suggesting instead that farmers double down and expand cropland locally in response to lower productivity.</div>

  <div class="popup" id="work3" style="display:none">Climate change poses a collective action problem: individual countries bear the costs of carbon regulation, while the benefits are shared globally. Carbon border adjustment mechanisms (CBAMs), which are currently being implemented by the EU and UK, aim to realign incentives by improving domestic competitiveness, reducing emissions leakage, and encouraging other countries to tax carbon. However, policy discussions also note that CBAMs could unfairly disadvantage lower-income trading partners. We evaluate these issues with a quantitative trade model and plant-level data for two key industries – steel and aluminum – which are the focus of early CBAM implementation. Together, they account for 14% of global emissions. We show that CBAMs can facilitate collective climate action, while largely avoiding disproportionate burdens on lower-income countries.</div>

  <div class="popup" id="work2" style="display:none">This paper argues that mobility across space greatly amplifies the returns to education. Students in isolated rural labor markets have limited job opportunities and thus limited wage gains from additional years of schooling. Access to urban labor markets provides more job opportunities and thus larger gains. I capture this mechanism with a spatial equilibrium model in which students invest in education, then migrate for employment after graduation. I estimate the model with quasi-experimental variation from Indonesia's <em>Sekolah Dasar Inpres</em> program, one of the largest school construction programs in history. I find that mobility accounts for roughly half of the aggregate gains from the program. Improving mobility would increase these gains, but also widen regional inequality.</div>

  <div class="popup" id="work1" style="display:none">Does electoral accountability discipline public spending? After the fall of Suharto, Indonesia held local elections for the first time in decades. I use a dynamic discrete choice framework to study how democratization affected the spatial allocation of public investment in healthcare infrastructure. On one hand, democratization limits distortions from Suharto-era biases toward certain areas, such as those within the patronage network. On the other hand, spillover effects are less internalized as districts become more focused on their own constituents. The first effect dominates, and democratization decreases misallocation overall.</div>

  <div class="popup" id="paper5" style="display:none">This paper studies how governments intervene in agricultural markets to reshape the economic consequences of climate extremes. We construct a global dataset of agricultural policies and extreme heat exposure by country and crop since 1980. Extreme heat shocks to domestic production lead to policies that assist consumers by lowering domestic food prices. This effect is persistent, primarily implemented via border policies, and stronger during election years. Shocks to foreign production induce the opposite response: policies that assist producers by raising prices. These findings can be rationalized by a model in which governments use agricultural policy to redistribute among domestic interest groups. Our estimates imply that policy responses shield domestic consumers, while exacerbating losses for domestic producers and foreign consumers. Policy responses have regressive consequences globally, disproportionately harming poor and heat-exposed countries.</div>

  <div class="popup" id="paper4" style="display:none">Weak environmental regulation has global consequences. When domestic regulation fails, the international community can target emitters with trade policy. I develop a dynamic empirical framework for evaluating trade policy as a substitute for domestic regulation, and I apply the framework to the market for palm oil, a major driver of deforestation and global CO₂ emissions. Relative to business as usual, a domestic production tax of 50% reduces CO₂ emissions by 7.4 Gt from 1988 to 2016, amounting to 0.26 Gt annually. Coordinated, committed import tariffs of similar magnitude reduce emissions by 5.4 Gt over the same period. The cost of these import tariffs is only $15 per ton of CO₂, even accounting for compensating transfers that recognize welfare losses for producing countries. Without coordination and commitment, import tariffs have more limited effects. Alternative policies include domestic export taxes, which are fiscally appealing independent of emission concerns, and a carbon border adjustment mechanism, which encourages domestic regulation.</div>

  <div class="popup" id="paper3" style="display:none">We surveyed voters and politicians in advance of the 2024 Indonesian election to measure preferences for environmental policy. We find that politicians underestimate voter concerns. We conducted an informational experiment with politicians to correct these misperceptions, and we document evidence of learning but no greater support for policy action. We explore three explanations for why voter preferences do not translate into policy. First, politicians only consider acting when their initial misperceptions are particularly large. Second, elite capture prevents politicians from implementing environmental protection. Third, voters prioritize progress in other domains. Our results underscore the multiplicity of challenges facing climate action.</div>
