  <div class="popup" id="abs1" style="display:none; color:#696969">Weak environmental regulation has global consequences. When domestic regulation fails, the international community can intervene by targeting emitters with import tariffs. I develop a dynamic empirical framework for evaluating import tariffs as a substitute for domestic regulation, and I apply it to the market for palm oil, a major driver of deforestation and one of the largest sources of emissions globally. Coordinated, committed tariffs reduce emissions by 39% relative to 40% under domestic regulation, but free-riding concerns undermine coordination and static incentives undermine commitment.</div>

  <div class="popup" id="abs2" style="display:none; color:#696969">Does electoral accountability discipline public spending? After the fall of Suharto, Indonesia held local elections for the first time in decades. I use a dynamic discrete choice framework to study how democratization affected the spatial allocation of public investment in healthcare infrastructure. On one hand, democratization limits distortions from Suharto-era biases toward certain areas, such as those within the patronage network. On the other hand, spillover effects are less internalized as districts become more focused on their own constituents.</div>

  <p style="margin-bottom:0">Educational Investment in Spatial Equilibrium: Evidence from Indonesia</p>

  <div class="popup" id="abs3" style="display:none; color:#696969">This paper quantifies the long-run aggregate and distributional effects of Indonesia's Sekolah Dasar INPRES program, one of the largest school construction programs in history. I do so with a spatial equilibrium model in which students invest in education, then migrate for employment after graduation. I find that the program increased aggregate output by 8%, with large gains for rural students but small gains for rural regions. Labor market integration magnifies each effect, as education and migration are complements: access to high urban wages raises the returns to education, but also encourages students to leave rural regions behind.</div>

  <p style="margin-bottom:0">Sea Level Rise and Urban Adaptation in Jakarta</p>
  <div class="buttonbar">[ 
    <button class="button" onclick="button(&quot;abs4&quot;)">abstract</button>
    | <a href="/files/Hsiao_jakarta.pdf">paper</a> 
  ]</div>
  <div class="popup" id="abs4" style="display:none; color:#696969">Sea level rise poses an existential threat to Jakarta, which faces frequent and worsening flooding. The government has responded with a proposed sea wall. In this setting, I study how government intervention complicates long-run adaptation to climate change. I show that government intervention creates coastal moral hazard, and I quantify this force with a dynamic spatial model in which developers and residents act with flood risk in mind. I find that moral hazard generates severe lock-in and limits migration inland, even over the long run.</div>
